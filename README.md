# THE TRINITY PROJECT
#### A way to TRUE/FULL P2P/IOT/Evernet

Transmit data between peers regardless of the underlying decentralization technology they are connected with.

The Trinity Project is a three fold concept, which combines

1. A P2P hybrid browser https://github.com/ducksandgoats/hybrid-browser
2. A Downloadable exe/app which is a P2P relay, running as a background service on your PC or mobile (support/help your favorite websites to de-centralize them, for instance Wikipedia)
3. A Webclient for your next (p2p website, app ,client, server, api) which acts also as a relay. https://github.com/draeder/decentralize
