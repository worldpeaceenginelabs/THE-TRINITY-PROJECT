# Trinity-Concept
#### A TRUE/FULL P2P/IOT concept

Transmit data between peers regardless of the underlying decentralization technology they are connected with.

The Trinity Project is a three fold concept, which combines

1. A P2P hybrid browser https://github.com/ducksandgoats/hybrid-browser
2. Downloadable exe/app which is a P2P relay, running as background service on your PC or mobile (support your favorite websites to de-centralize, for instance Wikipedia)
3. Webclient for your next (p2p website, app ,client, server, api) which act also as relays. https://github.com/draeder/decentralize
