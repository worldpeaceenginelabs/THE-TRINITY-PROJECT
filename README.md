2. A P2P backend-management (support/help your favorite websites to de-centralize them) https://github.com/draeder/donate-decentralize
3. A webcomponent which activates all your favourite decentralized stacks, and provides your fanbase a tracker donation feature, for your next new or existing p2p (website, app ,client, server, api) https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/DONATE-DECENTRALIZE-UI
